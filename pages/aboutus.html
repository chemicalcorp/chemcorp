        <h3 style="text-align: left;">Values</h3>
        <hr/>
        Corporate Vision and Mission derive from those that are the foundation of shared values that guide the activities of CCPL and form the basis of our way of being and working.
        People are the main and constant point of reference for our actions.
        RESPECT: colleagues, customers, suppliers, environment, rules and principles of working.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h5 style="text-align: left;">PROACTIVITY</h5> 
        That's our capacity to anticipate events. We cannot wait and only solve problems when they appear. Anticipation will give us a better future because we are building it by ourselves.
        <h5 style="text-align: left;">INNOVATION</h5> 
        Innovation is everywhere in technology and in organizations outside our company. To be innovative we prepare the future, we solve problems and bring to our customers new solutions
        <h5 style="text-align: left;">ACCOUNTABILITY</h5> 
        Accountability means we are responsible for what we do. Individually and collectively. Accountable for the time, the money, all resources spent and the results obtained 
        <h5 style="text-align: left;">COMMUNICATION</h5> 
        Relationship is the link between people. Building constructive relationships between us and with our customers is the basis of our success. Good relationships contribute to a good climate to work together. 
        <h5 style="text-align: left;">TEAM SPIRIT</h5> 
        It is the attitude of working together, sharing information and knowledge through the same objective. We are cooperative.
        <h5 style="text-align: left;">CONTINUOUS LEARNING</h5> 
        Learning, share information & knowledge, give everybody an opportunity to grow. What we have learnt years ago will become rapidly obsolete and new learning is vital for all of us.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        These shared values distinguish CCPL in the market for its unique style, outiside and inside the company. This has enabled us to become the most trusted supplier and distributer in the market with focus on quality and timely delivery.
