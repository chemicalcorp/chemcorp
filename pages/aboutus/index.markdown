        <br/>
        <h5 style="text-align: left;">PROACTIVITY</h5> 
        That's our capacity to anticipate events. We cannot wait and only solve problems when they appear. Anticipation will give us a better future because we are building it by ourselves.

        Innovation is everywhere in technology and in organizations outside our company. To be innovative we prepare the future, we solve problems and bring to our customers new solutions
        <h5 style="text-align: left;">ACCOUNTABILITY</h5> 
        Accountability means we are responsible for what we do. Individually and collectively. Accountable for the time, the money, all resources spent and the results obtained 
        <h5 style="text-align: left;">COMMUNICATION</h5> 
        Relationship is the link between people. Building constructive relationships between us and with our customers is the basis of our success. Good relationships contribute to a good climate to work together.
