It is also used as a raw-material for rosin and tall oil esters, in the manufacture of high quality oil based varnishes, as a raw-material to C5 - C11 mono carboxylic acid esters, components for synthetic aircraft gas turbine lubricants. It is a raw-material for plasticizers, heat stabilizers, intumescents used in flame retardent paints, chlorinated polyether resins and multifunctional acrylatemonomers. It can be used to produce synthetic drying oils of good quality by esterification reaction with linseed oil, tung oil, or other natural drying oils, or by ester exchange and other reactions with fatty acid esters. Pentaerythritol based resin esters are used in a variety of products including paints, varnishes, lacquers, printing inks, floor coverings and adhesives. Its esters of fatty acids are used as plasticizers for PVC resins.
