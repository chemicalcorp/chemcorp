description: Nearly all Methyl Methacrylate (MMA) is polymerised to make homopolymers and copolymers with the largest application being the casting, moulding or extrusion of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) or modified polymers. Over 80% of MMA consumption is accounted for in the construction and automotive industries and by original equipment manufacture. It is also used as a comonomer in paints and coatings. It is used in the impregnation of concrete to make it water-repellent, and also has uses in the fields of medicine and dentistry to make prosthetic devices and as a ceramic filler or cement.
