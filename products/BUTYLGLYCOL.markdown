description: Butyl glycol usage is dominated by the paint industry which consumes approximately 75 % of all production. <br><br> Other applications include use as a solvent in printing inks and textile dyes and as a component of hydraulic fluids. It is also a component of drilling and cutting oils and is a major component of Corexit 9527, which is an oil spill dispersant product. <br><br>It is also a chemical intermediate and, as such, is a starting material in the production of butyl glycol acetate which is, itself, an excellent solvent.  It is also a starting material in the production of plasticisers by the reaction of phthalic anhydride. <br><br>Butyl glycol is also something that is used regularly in most households as it is a component of many home cleaning products.  It provides very good cleaning power for domestic cleaning products and also provides the characteristic odour that we associate with many of these products.  It also plays the same role in some industrial and commercial surface cleaners.
