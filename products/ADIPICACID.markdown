description: Almost 90 percent of adipic acid produced is used in the production of nylon 66. The nylon, which has a protein-like structure, is further processed into fibers for applications in carpeting, automobile tire cord, and clothing. Adipic acid is also used to manufacture plasticizers and lubricant components. <br><br> Food grade adipic acid is used as a gelling aid, an acidulant, and as a leavening and buffering agent. <br><br> Adipic acid produced annually is used as a monomer for the production of nylon by a polycondensation reaction with hexamethylene diamine forming 6,6-nylon. Other applications include some Polyurethanes. Esters of Adipic Acid, such as DOA (Di-2-Ethylhexyl Adipate) are used as plasticizers for PolyVinyl Chloride (PVC) resins. <br><br>Adipic acid has been incorporated into controlled-release tablets to obtain a pH-independent release for both weakly basic and weakly acidic drugs. It has also been incorporated into polymeric coatings of hydrophilic monolithic systems to modulate the pH, resulting in zero-order release of a hydrophilic drug. <br><br> In foods, small but significant amounts of adipic acid are used as a food ingredient as a flavorant and gelling aid. It is used in some calcium carbonate antacids to make them tart.
