description: Triethyl orthoformate is used in Bodroux-Chichibabin aldehyde synthesis to prepare an aldehyde with one carbon higher by reacting with Grignard reagent. It is used in the electrophilic formylation of activated aromatic species such as phenol. It is also used as a reagent for acetylization and imidic ester formation. It is a useful building block for creating methoxymethylene groups and heterocyclic ring systems. It is used in the production of the fungicides, azoxystrobin and picoxystrobin, as well as for some members of the floxacin family of antibacterial drugs. A number of pharmaceutical intermediates are also made from it. It is also used as a food additive.
