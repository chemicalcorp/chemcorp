description: It is used in the synthesis of alkyd and polyester resins, Electric insulation coatings, PU-foams and lacquers, glues and adhesives. Furthermore it is used for the production of dyestuffs and silicone products. Acrylated and alkoxylated TMP's are used as multifunctional monomers to produce various coatings, Ethoxylated and propoxylated TMP, derived condensation of from TMP and the epoxides, are used for production of flexible polyurethanes.Â  Its derivatives are precursors to high-gloss coatings and ion exchange resins. It is also used in making of glues and lubricating oils. It is used in saturated polyesters for coil coatings, alkyds for paints, polyurethanes for coatings and elastomers, acrylic acid esters for radiation curing, esters for synthetic lubricants, rosin esters and for surface treatment of pigments.
