description: The primary use of PA is as a chemical intermediate in the production of plastics from vinyl chloride. Phthalate esters that function as plasticizers are derived from it (PVC). It has another major use in the production of polyester resins and other minor uses in the production of alkyd resins used in paints and lacquers, certain guys, insect repellents, and urethane polyester polyols. It has also been used as a rubber scorch inhibitor and retarder. <br> <br> The second largest outlet for PA around 18% is in unsaturated polyester resins (UPR) which are usually blended with glass fibers to produce fiberglass-reinforced plastics. Principal markets are construction, marine and transportation. <br> <br> The third largest outlet is PA-based alkyd resins that are used in solvent-based coatings for architectural, machinery, furniture and fixture applications. Small volume uses for PA include the manufacture of dyes and pigments, detergents, herbicides and insecticides, fire retardants, saccharin and polyester resin cross-linking agents.
